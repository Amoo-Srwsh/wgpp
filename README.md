# WGPP - Programming language

This is the continuation of my first ["programming language"](https://github.com/jdpmm/wgdi) which is interpreted, but i wanna go beyond it, and make a better programming language, so this is my compiled programming language.

Every assembly code will be saved at `./src/out`
