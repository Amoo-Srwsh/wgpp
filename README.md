# WGPP - Programming language

This is the continuation of my first ["programming language"](https://github.com/jdpmm/wgdi) which is interpreted, but i wanna go beyond it, and make a better programming language, so this is my compiled programming language.

Every assembly code will be saved at `./src/out`

## Difference between wout and printf

The difference between these functions is that `wout` only can print strings or the value of any variable with a new line at the end, instead `printf` function works like `printf` function in C programming language, you can print strings and values of variables in the same line

## Done
* [x] Exit function with numbers
* [x] Ignore comments and whitespaces
* [x] Print strings
* [x] Many instructions in one line
* [x] Intger variables
* [x] Print integer variables
* [x] Exit with variable
* [x] Printf function
* [x] Scape characters
* [x] Arithmetic


## To Do
* With GNU Assembly
* Make better error reports
* Check type variables in exit and print functions
* Overwrite variables
* Change the value of variables
